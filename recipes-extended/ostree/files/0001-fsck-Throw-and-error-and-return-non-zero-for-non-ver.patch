Subject: [PATCH 1/7] fsck: Throw and error and return non-zero for
 non-verified commits

After the corruption has been fixed with "ostree fsck -a --delete", a
second run of the "ostree fsck" command will print X partial commits
not verified and exit with a zero.

The zero exit code makes it hard to detect if a repair operation needs
to be run, it is easier to check an exit code than try to parse the
text that is emitted from the ostree fsck.
