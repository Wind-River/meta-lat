## How to run an instance of container with docker
        $ docker load -i DEPLOYDIR/@IMAGE_NAME@.docker-image.tar.bz2

### Run an instance of a container
        $ docker run -it @IMAGE_NAME@:latest

## How to run an instance of container with runc
Use runc command to create an instance of a container for a bundle.
A standard container bundle contains all the information needed to load
and run a container. Use a tool umoci to convert an OCI Image to
a Bundle for runc to run

An example to run an instance of a container with runc:
        $ umoci unpack --rootless --image DEPLOYDIR/@IMAGE_NAME@.rootfs-oci:latest container-bundle
        $ cd container-bundle
        $ runc run CONTAINER-ID

Where CONTAINER-ID is the name for the instance of the container

## How to upload image to docker registry
Run skopeo copy to upload container image:
   skopeo copy <option> docker-archive:DEPLOYDIR/@IMAGE_NAME@.docker-image.tar.bz2 docker://docker-registry/@IMAGE_NAME@

docker://docker-reference
 An image in a registry implementing the "Docker Registry HTTP API V2".
 By default, uses the authorization state in either $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/
 containers/auth.json, which is set using (skopeo login). If the authorization
 state is not found there, $HOME/.docker/config.json is checked, which is
 set using (docker login). If Docker Registry is insecure registry, add
 --dest-tls-verify=false to <option>

## Known issues
- ecryptfs-utils
ecryptfs-utils includes a systemd service ecryptfs.service and a kernel module
ecryptfs.ko. To make ecryptfs.service in container start successfully,
ecryptfs.ko must be inserted in the host system first either by ecryptfs.service
or manually. And then ecryptfs.service in the host system must be stopped,
otherwise it would hold /dev/ecryptfs and prevents ecryptfs.service in container
from accessing /dev/ecryptfs.
In general, a container may depend on some features or devices in the host
system. How to formally handle such dependencies is to be discussed.
