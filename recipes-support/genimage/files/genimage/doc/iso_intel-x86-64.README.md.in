# Wind River Linux ustart images

The images are built from Wind River Linux Assembly Tool Application SDK

## Features
Arch: x86_64 (corei7_64)

### ostree
OSTree is a system for versioning updates of Linux-based operating
systems. It can be considered as "Git for operating system binaries".
It operates in userspace, and will work on top of any Linux file system.
At its core is a Git-like content-addressed object store with branches
(or "refs") to track meaningful file system trees within the store.
Similarly, one can check out or commit to these branches.

#### Ostree Upgrade

  $ ostree_upgrade.sh

This command wraps the ostree admin commands and handles the upgrade
using a single or multi-partition device in order to obtain the
specified branch configured in /sysroot/ostree/repo/config.

  Optional commands:

  -b   reboot after completion
  -e   Erase the /var volume on the next reboot
  -E   FORMAT the /var volume when on a separate partition on the next reboot
  -f   Force /etc to be entirely reset to the initial deploy state
  -r   Redeploy the current branch without doing a network pull
  -s   Skip the fsck integrity checks

  -F   Local Redeploy and Reset, uses -b -e -f -r -s
  -U   Factory upgrade reset, uses -b -e -f -s

NOTE: On target, run ostree_upgrade.sh to update the image rather than
'ostree pull'. Use "ostree remote add NAME xxx" to add remote repo
if not present.

## Supported BSPs
- intel-x86-64

## How to install/boot binary image
### On Board
Under Linux, insert a USB flash drive.  Assuming the USB flash drive
takes device /dev/sdX, use dd to copy the image to it.  Before the image
can be burned onto a USB drive, it should be un-mounted. Some Linux distros
may automatically mount a USB drive when it is plugged in. Using USB device
/dev/sdX as an example, find all mounted partitions:

    $ mount | grep sdf

and un-mount those that are mounted, for example:

    $ umount /dev/sdX1
    $ umount /dev/sdX2

Now burn the image onto the USB drive:
    $ sudo dd if=@IMAGE_NAME@-cd.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress

    $ sync
    $ eject /dev/sdX

This should give you a bootable USB flash device.  Insert the device
into a bootable USB socket on the target, and power on.  This should
result in a system booted to the Grub boot menuo.

## Install a package
### Ostree Upgrade
Prerequisite: The remote ostree repo is available (The ostree_remote_url of
ostree section in Yaml is set correctly)

Because dnf can't upgrade kernel on the ostree image, so run the following
command to ensure kernel is up to date and reboot, this action is only needed
when kernel is upgraded in the repo.
    $ ostree_upgrade.sh -b

Note, the previous action is only needed when kernel is upgraded in the repo,
otherwise it is not needed.
