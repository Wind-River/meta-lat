# Wind River Linux ustart images

The images are built from Wind River Linux Assembly Tool Application SDK

## Features
Arch: x86_64 (corei7_64)

### ostree
OSTree is a system for versioning updates of Linux-based operating
systems. It can be considered as "Git for operating system binaries".
It operates in userspace, and will work on top of any Linux file system.
At its core is a Git-like content-addressed object store with branches
(or "refs") to track meaningful file system trees within the store.
Similarly, one can check out or commit to these branches.

#### Ostree Upgrade

  $ ostree_upgrade.sh

This command wraps the ostree admin commands and handles the upgrade
using a single or multi-partition device in order to obtain the
specified branch configured in /sysroot/ostree/repo/config.

  Optional commands:

  -b   reboot after completion
  -e   Erase the /var volume on the next reboot
  -E   FORMAT the /var volume when on a separate partition on the next reboot
  -f   Force /etc to be entirely reset to the initial deploy state
  -r   Redeploy the current branch without doing a network pull
  -s   Skip the fsck integrity checks

  -F   Local Redeploy and Reset, uses -b -e -f -r -s
  -U   Factory upgrade reset, uses -b -e -f -s

NOTE: On target, run ostree_upgrade.sh to update the image rather than
'ostree pull'. Use "ostree remote add NAME xxx" to add remote repo
if not present.

## Supported BSPs
- intel-x86-64
- qemux86-64

## How to install/boot binary image
### On Board
Under Linux, insert a USB flash drive.  Assuming the USB flash drive
takes device /dev/sdX, use dd to copy the image to it.  Before the image
can be burned onto a USB drive, it should be un-mounted. Some Linux distros
may automatically mount a USB drive when it is plugged in. Using USB device
/dev/sdX as an example, find all mounted partitions:

    $ mount | grep sdf

and un-mount those that are mounted, for example:

    $ umount /dev/sdX1
    $ umount /dev/sdX2

Now burn the image onto the USB drive:
    $ sudo dd if=deploy/@IMAGE_NAME@-cd.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress

    $ sync
    $ eject /dev/sdX

This should give you a bootable USB flash device.  Insert the device
into a bootable USB socket on the target, and power on.  This should
result in a system booted to the Grub boot menuo.

### On Qemu + EFI
Create a disk image
    $ qemu-img create -f raw boot-image-qemu.hddimg 16G

Prepare OVMF images
    $ cp -f deploy/@ovmf_code@ OVMF_CODE.fd
    $ cp -f deploy/ovmf.vars.qcow2 OVMF_VARS.fd
@OVMF_ISO_EXTRA@

#### Qemu Simulator
qemu-system-x86_64

#### Qemu Networking
Create a SLiRP user network
`-net nic -net user`

#### Qemu Memory
Set guest startup RAM size, @MEM@MB
`-m @MEM@

#### Qemu Image
Use virtio-scsi-pci to load image
`-drive if=none,id=hd,file=boot-image-qemu.hddimg,format=raw -device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scsi -device scsi-hd,drive=hd`

#### Qemu CD ROM
-cdrom ./deploy/@IMAGE_NAME@-cd.iso

#### Qemu Exit after LAT installing
Due to qemu does not have command options to eject CD ROM,
exit rather than reboot after LAT installing
`-no-reboot`

#### Qemu CPU
- KVM
KVM has better performance based on virtualization as most of guest
instruction can be executed directly on the host processor.
`-cpu kvm64 -enable-kvm`
If kvm failed, please refer:
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/How_to_enable_KVM_for_Poky_qemu

If above refer does not work (such as you do not have root right to enable kvm)

- For qemu x86_64, please simulate Intel Core i7 9xx (Nehalem Class Core i7)
`-cpu Nehalem`

#### Qemu Bootloader
Enable UEFI support for Virtual Machines
`-drive if=pflash,format=qcow2,file=OVMF_CODE.fd -drive if=pflash,format=qcow2,file=OVMF_VARS.fd`

#### Qemu No Graphic
Disable graphical output and redirect serial I/Os to console
`-nographic

## Install a package
### Ostree Upgrade
Prerequisite: The remote ostree repo is available (The ostree_remote_url of
ostree section in Yaml is set correctly)

Because dnf can't upgrade the kernel on the ostree image, so run the following
command to ensure kernel is up to date and reboot, this action is only needed
when kernel is upgraded in the repo.
    $ ostree_upgrade.sh -b

Note, the previous action is only needed when kernel is upgraded in the repo,
otherwise it is not needed.
