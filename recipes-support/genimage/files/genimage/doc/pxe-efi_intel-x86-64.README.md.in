# Wind River Linux LAT PXE for EFI Boot

The files of PXE for EFI boot are built from Wind River Linux Assembly Tool Application SDK

## Features
Arch: x86_64 (corei7_64)

### ostree
OSTree is a system for versioning updates of Linux-based operating
systems. It can be considered as "Git for operating system binaries".
It operates in userspace, and will work on top of any Linux file system.
At its core is a Git-like content-addressed object store with branches
(or "refs") to track meaningful file system trees within the store.
Similarly, one can check out or commit to these branches.

#### Ostree Upgrade

  $ ostree_upgrade.sh

This command wraps the ostree admin commands and handles the upgrade
using a single or multi-partition device in order to obtain the
specified branch configured in /sysroot/ostree/repo/config.

  Optional commands:

  -b   reboot after completion
  -e   Erase the /var volume on the next reboot
  -E   FORMAT the /var volume when on a separate partition on the next reboot
  -f   Force /etc to be entirely reset to the initial deploy state
  -r   Redeploy the current branch without doing a network pull
  -s   Skip the fsck integrity checks

  -F   Local Redeploy and Reset, uses -b -e -f -r -s
  -U   Factory upgrade reset, uses -b -e -f -s

NOTE: On target, run ostree_upgrade.sh to update the image rather than
'ostree pull'. Use "ostree remote add NAME xxx" to add remote repo
if not present.

## Supported BSPs
- intel-x86-64
- qemux86-64

## How to install/boot binary image
### On Board
####
Extract PXE tarball
tar -xvf pxe-tftp-@IMAGE_NAME@.tar

#### Setup a TFTP server on host
Specify TFTP dir to path-to/pxe_tftp_@IMAGE_NAME@

#### Setup a DHCP server on host
Edit /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
```
# For LAN card ROM booting:
option tftp-server-address <IPv4 of TFTP server>;
filename "EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi";
# For iPXE:
next-server <IPv4 of TFTP server>;
```
#### PXE for EFI BOOT
Boot board from EFI and choose PXE

### On Qemu
Create a disk image
    $ qemu-img create -f raw boot-image-qemu.hddimg 16G

Prepare OVMF images
    $ cp -f deploy/ovmf.qcow2 OVMF_CODE.fd
    $ cp -f deploy/ovmf.vars.qcow2 OVMF_VARS.fd

For qemu x86_64 with KVM:

    $ qemu-system-x86_64 -m @MEM@ \
        -drive if=none,id=hd,file=boot-image-qemu.hddimg,format=raw \
        -device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scsi -device scsi-hd,drive=hd \
        -drive file=OVMF_CODE.fd,format=raw,readonly=on,if=pflash,unit=0 \
        -drive if=pflash,format=raw,unit=1,file=OVMF_VARS.fd \
        -net nic -net user,tftp=./deploy/pxe_tftp_@IMAGE_NAME@,bootfile=EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi \
        -cpu kvm64 -enable-kvm

For qemu x86_64 without KVM:

    $ qemu-system-x86_64 -m @MEM@ \
        -drive if=none,id=hd,file=boot-image-qemu.hddimg,format=raw \
        -device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scsi -device scsi-hd,drive=hd \
        -drive file=OVMF_CODE.fd,format=raw,readonly=on,if=pflash,unit=0 \
        -drive if=pflash,format=raw,unit=1,file=OVMF_VARS.fd \
        -net nic -net user,tftp=./deploy/pxe_tftp_@IMAGE_NAME@,bootfile=EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi \
        -cpu Nehalem

#### Qemu Simulator
qemu-system-x86_64

#### Qemu Networking
Create a SLiRP user network and specify built-in TFTP, bootfile for EFI
`-net nic -net user,tftp=./deploy/pxe_tftp_@IMAGE_NAME@,bootfile=EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi`

#### Qemu Memory
Set guest startup RAM size, @MEM@MB
`-m @MEM@

#### Qemu Image
Use virtio-scsi-pci to load image
`-drive if=none,id=hd,file=boot-image-qemu.hddimg,format=raw -device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scsi -device scsi-hd,drive=hd`

#### Qemu CPU
- KVM
KVM has better performance based on virtualization as most of guest
instruction can be executed directly on the host processor.
`-cpu kvm64 -enable-kvm`
If kvm failed, please refer:
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/How_to_enable_KVM_for_Poky_qemu

If above refer does not work (such as you do not have root right to enable kvm)

- For qemu x86_64, please simulate Intel Core i7 9xx (Nehalem Class Core i7)
`-cpu Nehalem`

#### Qemu Bootloader
Enable UEFI support for Virtual Machines
`-drive file=OVMF_CODE.fd,format=raw,readonly=on,if=pflash,unit=0 -drive if=pflash,format=raw,unit=1,file=OVMF_VARS.fd`

#### Qemu No Graphic
Disable graphical output and redirect serial I/Os to console
`-nographic`

### On VirtualBox
####
Extract PXE tarball
tar -xvf pxe-tftp-@IMAGE_NAME@.tar
 
#### Setup a TFTP server on host
Specify TFTP dir to path-to/pxe_tftp_@IMAGE_NAME@

#### Create virtual machine
Create a VM, name as <VM-NAME>, set memory size >= @MEM@MB, disk size >= 16GB

#### Enable EFI
```
'System'-> Enable EFI(special OSes only)
```

#### Set Boot Order
```
'System'-> Boot Order: Network
```

#### Config net for virtual machine
```
'Setting'-> 'Network'-> Attached to: NAT
                        Advanced -> Adapter Type: Paravirtualized Network (virtio-net)
```

#### Set TFTP dir and Boot File
```
    $ vboxmanage modifyvm <VM-NAME> --nic1 nat \
        --nattftpfile1 EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi \
        --nataliasmode1 proxyonly \
        --nattftpserver1 <IPv4 of TFTP server>
```

## Install a package
### Ostree Upgrade
Prerequisite: The remote ostree repo is available (The ostree_remote_url of
ostree section in Yaml is set correctly)

Because dnf can't upgrade kernel on the ostree image, so run the following
command to ensure kernel is up to date and reboot, this action is only needed
when kernel is upgraded in the repo.
    $ ostree_upgrade.sh -b

Note, the previous action is only needed when kernel is upgraded in the repo,
otherwise it is not needed.
