# Wind River Linux wic images

The images are built from Wind River Linux Assembly Tool Application SDK

## Features
Arch: aarch64 (cortexa72)

### ostree
OSTree is a system for versioning updates of Linux-based operating
systems. It can be considered as "Git for operating system binaries".
It operates in userspace, and will work on top of any Linux file system.
At its core is a Git-like content-addressed object store with branches
(or "refs") to track meaningful file system trees within the store.
Similarly, one can check out or commit to these branches.

#### Ostree Upgrade

  $ ostree_upgrade.sh

This command wraps the ostree admin commands and handles the upgrade
using a single or multi-partition device in order to obtain the
specified branch configured in /sysroot/ostree/repo/config.

  Optional commands:

  -b   reboot after completion
  -e   Erase the /var volume on the next reboot
  -E   FORMAT the /var volume when on a separate partition on the next reboot
  -f   Force /etc to be entirely reset to the initial deploy state
  -r   Redeploy the current branch without doing a network pull
  -s   Skip the fsck integrity checks

  -F   Local Redeploy and Reset, uses -b -e -f -r -s
  -U   Factory upgrade reset, uses -b -e -f -s

NOTE: On target, run ostree_upgrade.sh to update the image rather than
'ostree pull'. Use "ostree remote add NAME xxx" to add remote repo
if not present.

## Supported BSPs
- bcm-2xxx-rpi4
- qemuarm64

## How to install/boot binary image
### On Board
Under Linux, insert a micro SD card to a USB SD Card Reader.
Assuming the USB SD Card Reader takes device /dev/sdX, use dd
to copy the image to it. Before the image can be burned onto
a micro SD card, it should be un-mounted. Some Linux distros
may automatically mount when it is plugged in. Using device
/dev/sdX as an example, find all mounted partitions:

    $ mount | grep sdf

and un-mount those that are mounted, for example:

    $ umount /dev/sdX1
    $ umount /dev/sdX2

Now burn the image onto the micro SD card:
    $ sudo dd if=deploy/@IMAGE_NAME@.wic of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress

    $ sync
    $ eject /dev/sdX

This should give you a bootable micro SD card device. Insert the
SD card into SD slot, and then power on.

The image will be installed on the boot disk (SD card) by default, you can
press any key except 'y' to stop the installation and select other disks to
install:

## Erasing /dev/sda in 60 sec ## 'y' = start ## Any key to abort ##
## Erasing /dev/sda in 59 sec ## 'y' = start ## Any key to abort ##
    NAME   VENDOR    SIZE MODEL            TYPE LABEL
0 - sda    QEMU        8G QEMU HARDDISK    disk
B - Reboot
Select disk to format and install:

You will see the login console after the installation is done and rebooted,
login with root and change password for the first login.

### On Qemu: Way 1 - Use qemu in SDK
Create a disk image
    $ qemu-img create -f raw boot-image-qemu.hddimg 14G

Prepare u-boot images
    $ cp -f deploy/qemu-u-boot-bcm-2xxx-rpi4.bin qemu-u-boot-bcm-2xxx-rpi4.bin

Burn the image onto disk image:
    $ dd if=deploy/@IMAGE_NAME@.wic of=boot-image-qemu.hddimg conv=notrunc

For Qemu No Graphic:

    $ qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt -cpu cortex-a57 \
        -device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0 -netdev user,id=net0 \
        -m 1024 \
        -bios qemu-u-boot-bcm-2xxx-rpi4.bin \
        -nographic \
        -drive id=disk0,file=boot-image-qemu.hddimg,if=none,format=raw -device virtio-blk-device,drive=disk0

Or Qemu Graphic (XFCE desktop):

    $ qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt -cpu cortex-a57 \
        -device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0 -netdev user,id=net0 \
        -m 1024 \
        -bios qemu-u-boot-bcm-2xxx-rpi4.bin \
        -device virtio-gpu-pci -serial stdio \
        -device qemu-xhci -device usb-tablet -device usb-kbd \
        -drive id=disk0,file=boot-image-qemu.hddimg,if=none,format=raw -device virtio-blk-device,drive=disk0


#### Qemu Simulator
qemu-system-aarch64

#### Qemu Networking
Create a SLiRP user network
`-device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0 -netdev user,id=net0`

#### Qemu Memory
Set guest startup RAM size, 1024MB
`-m 1024`

#### Qemu Image
Use virtio-blk-device to load image
`-drive id=disk0,file=boot-image-qemu.hddimg,if=none,format=raw -device virtio-blk-device,drive=disk0`

#### Qemu CPU
Use QEMU 2.11 ARM Virtual Machine with CPU cortex-a57
`-machine virt -cpu cortex-a57`

#### Qemu Bootloader
Add pre-built qemu bootloader qemu-u-boot-bcm-2xxx-rpi4.bin
`-bios qemu-u-boot-bcm-2xxx-rpi4.bin`

#### Qemu No Graphic
Disable graphical output and redirect serial I/Os to console
`-nographic`

#### Qemu Graphic (XFCE desktop)
Enable graphical and redirect serial I/Os to console
`-device virtio-gpu-pci -serial stdio`

Add Mouse and Keyboard
-device qemu-xhci -device usb-tablet -device usb-kbd

### On Qemu: Way 2 - Use runqemu in SDK
For Qemu No Graphic:
Directly boot @IMAGE_NAME@.wic by runqemu which creates a SLiRP user
network, disable graphical output and redirect serial I/Os to console

    $ runqemu @IMAGE_NAME@.qemuboot.conf \
        nographic slirp

Or Qemu Graphic (XFCE desktop):
For some reason, the SDL graphic window does not open under certain
circumstances, so you might need to use another method such as VNC:

    $ runqemu @IMAGE_NAME@.qemuboot.conf \
        nographic publicvnc slirp

and then connect to it with:

    $ vncviewer <hostip>:0

## Install a package
### Ostree Upgrade
Prerequisite: The remote ostree repo is available (The ostree_remote_url of
ostree section in Yaml is set correctly)

Because dnf can't upgrade kernel on the ostree image, so run the following
command to ensure kernel is up to date and reboot, this action is only needed
when kernel is upgraded in the repo.
    $ ostree_upgrade.sh -b

Note, the previous action is only needed when kernel is upgraded in the repo,
otherwise it is not needed.
