# Wind River Linux target images

The images are built from Wind River Linux, which support ostree, docker, kubernetes, xfce and other features in the packages feeds. The images can be highly customized, they can be customized by package manager dnf, or use the script gen-image to rebuild them from source.

## Features
Arch: x86-64 (dbfp5)
Package Manager: dnf
Features: ostree docker kubernetes xfce

### ostree
OSTree is a system for versioning updates of Linux-based operating
systems. It can be considered as "Git for operating system binaries".
It operates in userspace, and will work on top of any Linux file system.
At its core is a Git-like content-addressed object store with branches
(or "refs") to track meaningful file system trees within the store.
Similarly, one can check out or commit to these branches.

#### Ostree Upgrade

  $ ostree_upgrade.sh

This command wraps the ostree admin commands and handles the upgrade
using a single or multi-partition device in order to obtain the
specified branch configured in /sysroot/ostree/repo/config.

  Optional commands:

  -b   reboot after completion
  -e   Erase the /var volume on the next reboot
  -E   FORMAT the /var volume when on a separate partition on the next reboot
  -f   Force /etc to be entirely reset to the initial deploy state
  -r   Redeploy the current branch without doing a network pull
  -s   Skip the fsck integrity checks

  -F   Local Factory reset, uses -b -e -f -r -s
  -U   Factory upgrade reset, uses -b -e -f -s

NOTE: On target, run ostree_upgrade.sh to update the image rather than
'ostree pull'. Use "ostree remote add wrlinux xxx" to add remote repo
if not present.

## Supported BSPs
- AMD EPYC Embedded 3000 Series Snowy Owl platform

## How to install/boot binary image

### On Host PC
Under Linux, insert a USB flash drive.  Assuming the USB flash drive
takes device /dev/sdX, use dd to copy the image to it.  Before the image
can be burned onto a USB drive, it should be un-mounted. Some Linux distros
may automatically mount a USB drive when it is plugged in. Using USB device
/dev/sdX as an example, find all mounted partitions:

    $ mount | grep sdX

and un-mount those that are mounted, for example:

    $ sudo umount /dev/sdX*

Now burn the image onto the USB drive:
    $ zcat deploy/@IMAGE_NAME@.ustart.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress

    $ sync
    $ eject /dev/sdX

This should give you a bootable USB flash device.

### On Board
Insert the device into a bootable USB socket on the target, and power on.

The image will be installed on the boot disk (USB) by default, you can press
any key except 'y' to stop the installation and select other disks to install:

## Erasing /dev/sda in 60 sec ## 'y' = start ## Any key to abort ##
## Erasing /dev/sda in 59 sec ## 'y' = start ## Any key to abort ##
    NAME   VENDOR    SIZE MODEL            TYPE LABEL
0 - sda    QEMU        8G QEMU HARDDISK    disk
B - Reboot
Select disk to format and install:

You will see the login console after the installation is done and rebooted,
login with root and change password for the first login.

## Install a package
### Ostree Upgrade
Prerequisite: The remote ostree repo is available (The ostree_remote_url of
ostree section in Yaml is set correctly)

Because dnf can't upgrade the kernel on the ostree image, run the following
command to ensure kernel is up to date and reboot, this action is only needed
when the kernel is upgraded in the repo.
    $ ostree_upgrade.sh -b

Note, the previous action is only needed when the kernel is upgraded in the repo,
otherwise it is not needed.
